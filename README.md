These documents are introductory or reconnaissance security survey for internal departments or partners, projects and vendors.
They are light start to initiate contact when security conditions are not pre-existing or low level.

It does not replace further assessments which should take place once contacts are identified and seed of collaboration are there. Transparency and good communication are keys to a good discussion.
Also remember that the level of security is depending on risks involved. But in a deeply interconnected world, a certain minimal level is required. One approach is to define a scale of risk and a scale of security with corresponding assessment (from survey to on-site visit and technical audit). Ideally, scale is re-evaluated on a regular basis to improve global level.

* Random regular audits, be it of infrastructure, service or application depending on context
* Regular discussions and review of past incidents, metrics and what can be improve
* Shared exercises, table-tops and simulation
