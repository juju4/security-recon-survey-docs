Artificial Intelligence (AI) usage, policy & co

# AI/ML Governance Strategy
Define your purpose: trust, explainability, compliance...
Ask: What models are we building? Who owns the risks? What’s our stance on LLMs or autonomous systems?
Set your risk appetite and responsible AI principles.

Over half (52%) pointed to direct and indirect losses of at least $50 million arising from these incidents.

This setting is turned on by default, and you have to manually uncheck a box in order to opt out.  If you are a writer who uses MS Word to write any proprietary content (blog posts, novels, or any work you intend to protect with copyright and/or sell), you’re going to want to turn this feature off immediately."

It just doesn’t work, and it doesn’t deliver any level of accuracy. Gartner says it’s spilling data everywhere, and customers are left cleaning up the mess. To add insult to injury, customers are then told to build their own custom LLMs. I have yet to find anyone who’s had a transformational experience with Microsoft Copilot or the pursuit of training and retraining custom LLMs. Copilot is more like Clippy 2.0.🤷‍♂️#AI #Microsoft #Copilot https://www.fastcompany.com/91208578/why-marc-benioff-is-all-in-on-ai-agentforce"

Let’s be real—Copilot’s a flop because Microsoft lacks the data, metadata, and enterprise security models to create real corporate intelligence. That is why Copilot is inaccurate, spills corporate data, and forces customers to build their own LLMs. Clippy 2.0, anyone? Meanwhile, Agentforce is transforming businesses now.
