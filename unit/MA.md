Merge&Acquisition process is an important step in a life of a company, being acquired or acquiring another.
IT and Security must be reviewed before and after to ensure that assets are protected and that integration can be done smoothly.

## Course of Action

* Build relationship with the other team
* Data collection and planning
    * Inventory of assets (hardware, software, process)
    * Commonalities and differences
* Identify existing problems, how affected by M&A and if a fix is mandatory before or after.
* Management Requirements for day one
* Possible liabilities (past incidents, non-compliance...)
* Legal aspects: contracts, NDA...
    * recognize them as is
    * review, renegotiate...
* Integration path: from beginning to end
    * HR
    * Finance
    * Email, calendar
    * Network, VPN

## Technicalities

* Ask results of their latest audit, VAscan... Or do one.
* Use a security sensor or agents in their network to map it and check their documentation.
* Get and compare some process like patch management, change management, administrator rights approval.
* For privileged accounts, probably better to restart everyone as standard user and revalidate current requirements
* Identify what will be integrated into final network, what need to be rebuild, what use your architecture or what will be left out or kept in a segmented network zone.
* Pay attention to Identity and Access Management to keep best of both worlds, especially on Multi-Factor-Authentication tools.
* Have troubleshooting tool in place when migrating services
